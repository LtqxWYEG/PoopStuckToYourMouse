# ---------- General:
transparentColor =      #000000
	# global transparent color. No need to change
particleSize =          2
	# Size of particles in pixel * pixel
particleAge =           60
	# Modifier for time until brightness < 10 (death) OR max lifetime in frames
ageBrightnessMod =      5.30
	# increase for slower brightness decline (concavity of downward slope)
ageBrightnessNoise =    12
	# Adds (twinkling) random noise to age/brightness: Between +-ageBrightnessNoise. 0 for no noise
velocityMod =           1.60
	# lowers velocity added to particle based on mouse speed: mouse speed / velocityMod
velocityClamp =         200
	# max. particle velocity
GRAVITY =               0, 0.030
	# x, y motion added to any particle. maybe turn negative and simulate smoke or flames
drag =                  0.850
	# particle drag, higher equals less drag: (drag * particle speed) per frame
FPS =                   60
    # Frames per second. Also affects number of particles as they are spawned per frame.
interpolateMouseMovement = True
	# Interpolate mouse movement: Draw some particles between current position of the cursor and that of last frame. (Interpolation should have almost no effect on performance)
useOffset =             False
    # Add offset to the particle origin
offsetX =               0

offsetY =               0

markPosition =          False
	# Mark position of particle origin. Use for offset tuning

# ---------- Non-dynamic only:
numParticles =  1
	# per frame, if dynamic is False
randomMod =     5.50
	# adds random motion to particles: mouseSpeed(xy) +- randomMod

# ---------- Color:

ageColorSlope =         True
	# If ageColor = True: Age like concave downward curve. For more pronounced pink and blue colors (Or whatever is highest hue value of particleColor)
ageColorSlopeConcavity = 0.42
	# increase concavity of downward slope representing values over age. (Think: https://i.stack.imgur.com/bGi9k.jpg)
ageColorNoise =         12
	# Adds random noise to hue: Between +-ageColorNoise. 0 for no noise
ageColorNoiseMod =      0.500
	# (0.0 to 1.0 ) Shifts color noise weight to be more positive or negative: 0 = only positive noise, 0.5 = balanced, 1.0 = only negative noise, etc

# ---------- Dynamic only:
dynamic =           True
	# The faster the movement, the more particles and random motion will be added. For the SCREEEETCH-effect
randomModDynamic =  0.16
	# adds random motion to particles: velocity / randomModDynamic
printMouseSpeed =   False
	# Use for tuning the next parameters. Prints current mouse speed in pixels per frame.
